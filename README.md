  # Plagiarism Detection

This project was done using AWS(Amazon Web Services) Sagemaker. This project develops a model and trains it to detect plagiarism among numerous texts. 
SKLearn Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was used to classify the results. Binary classification was used to detect if the text is plagiarized or not.
The project was done as part of Udacity Nanodegreee program and the data was provided by Udacity.

  # Libraries included in the project
  SK-Learn, numpy, os, pandas, and more
  
  Two notebooks along with files for helper functions
  In the first notebook, data is uploaded and then explored. The data is then preprocessed and prepared for machine learning
  In the second notebook, training data is uploaded, a model is created, deployed and then tested.
  *Unit tests are provided by Udacity through out the notebook and there are also some critical questions and answers to help understand the subject better.
  
  I used SKLearn and achieved accuracy of 100%. This was binary classification with two possible answers of 0 and 1, along with limited data; it was easy to achieve this accuracy.
